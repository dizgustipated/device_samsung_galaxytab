I found this new way of thinking for devs, and decided to apply it to our SGT7 forum.

I'm calling it "Do it yourself"
as in, Do it yourself, learn a few things, and take pride in something you have made yourself.

Some will stop there.
A few will take developlment a step further
and fewer still will go beyond, and start contributing to android development.

So ive decided to get you started.


More to come!!
